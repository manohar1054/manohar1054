About Me
I hold an MBA in Finance from the Institute of Aeronautical Engineering and have completed a specialized Master Business Intelligence course with Creowiz. I recently completed a Data Analyst internship with Elevate Labs, where I worked on real-world projects involving data visualization, SQL-based analysis, and dashboard creation. I'm passionate about turning raw data into actionable insights using tools like Power BI, MS SQL Server, Tableau, and Excel.
